<p2 id="coolgamer">Micro Bits are circit boards that you can code to carry out tasks in multple ways.
    Our assignment was to create 2 servos to mover a propeler in differnt ways by moving the micro bit.
    Our end goal was to make two moter's on a side of a blimp to control the way the blimp moves by sterring it in differnet directions. The Micro bit codding system was hard to understand at first and the micro bits didn't work all the time so it was challenging. But with the help of some group members we were able to complete the assignment.</p2>
